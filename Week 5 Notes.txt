## Lesson 1: script tag, inspector's console and console.log
#### What is JS? What is programming?

How are we going to be using it? We will be using the console! Demo: where it is, console.log("Hello World!")

To save and run code without having to type it out in the console, we use a JS file, in HTML.

Script tag.

Exercise 1: Create an html file and a javascript file. Link the JS file to the HTML file using the script tag. Check that there are no errors in the Console.
Part 2: Put console.log("Hello world!") in the JS and check that it has worked using the console.
